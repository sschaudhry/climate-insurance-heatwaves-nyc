New York City faces a growing climate–health emergency, with 525 premature heat‑related deaths each year (DOHMH, 2025) and over 3,000 heat‑related emergency department visits annually (CDC, 2024). These impacts are concentrated in neighborhoods with high Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) scores, low air‑conditioning access, and lower median incomes.
