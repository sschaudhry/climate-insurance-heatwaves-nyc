This project builds a **parametric micro-insurance model** to deliver **rapid, no-paperwork payouts** to NYC’s most heat-vulnerable ZIP codes—where high Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) scores, low AC access, and low incomes drive disproportionate ER surges and heat-related deaths.

**Key visualizations** illustrate its equity and effectiveness:

* **Bar Chart:** Heat Vulnerability Drivers (Brownsville vs UES)
* **Health Burden Chart:** ER visits, asthma rates & heat deaths by neighborhood
* **Bubble Chart:** HVI distribution across six priority ZIPs
* **Scatter Plot:** Tiered Trigger-vs-Payout Events showing \$25–\$75 payouts aligned with 3-day heat-index thresholds

Together, these graphs demonstrate how **tiered payouts at lower heat-index triggers** concentrate relief in the areas that need it most, projecting a **15% reduction in ER surge costs** and strengthening climate resilience.
